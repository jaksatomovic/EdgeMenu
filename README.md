# EdgeMenu

 This is simple, clean and minimal menu for any iOS project. Also it is very quick and handy cause you can use all your screen for content without having to reserve some part of screen for your menu button. All you need is just swipe and hold from the right or left screen edge. The menu will be showing as long as you hold your finger on screen and by swiping up or down you can easily select your menu item. Next time you swipe you screen edge the last selected menu item will be preselect on start.
